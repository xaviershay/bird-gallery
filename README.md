### TODO

* Figure out why page takes 100ms (prob database?)
* Custom URL
* New mapbox API key
* Restrict font-awesome hosting to domains
* Recent firsts (or something else of interest) on home page.
* Document architecture and dev setup in README.
* Resize images for thumbnail versions.

### eBird API wants

* Exotic flags in exported observation data (example: https://ebird.org/checklist/S220837850). Use case: my own list calculations can match that of eBird.
* JSON API for download observations rather than request emailed file. Use case: easier to refresh my own calculations/dashboard.
* Ability to fetch lists of other users' (where displayed publicly). Use case: build some social features with my friends, e.g. "which bird have I seen that you haven't? I can show you" or "which bird in a region have neither of us seen"
