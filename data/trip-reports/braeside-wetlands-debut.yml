  Bought my first pair of bins, so visited a new location to celebrate. Thought it
  might be too hot (31C) but still plenty of birds around.

  Headed out clockwise around the lake, though heard an insistent chirp before I
  got there. Clear enough to get a recording of a Grey Fantail.

  The lake is very low. Walked out on to the dry bog to get a good look a
  Pink-Eared Duck and its brood, about 5 chicks, with a couple of Pied Stilt in
  the background. Also my first properly IDed Grey Teal.

  Was shocked by a Straw-necked Ibis sitting on a log, not a bird I expected would
  exist. Even better, right next to it a Little Black Cormorant.

  Spotted what I think were two Australian Reed Warbler on the way around, but
  wasn't sure so didn't tag them. Around at the hide, a Pelican I wasn't expecting
  and a Royal Spoonbill! They look incredible.

  Not long after saw a Great Cormorant I took a long time to ID. Didn't feel it
  had sufficient white patches the description and images on Merlin showed, but
  the face was dead on. Took a photo through the bins, which was dodgy but enough
  for an image search to give me confidence it was indeed the bird I thought it
  was.

  On the way back around got a clear view of a bird in a tree with the rough shape
  and beak of a kookaburra, but much darker. No idea what it was, and it flew off
  before I could figure it out or grab a photo. Other bird I failed to ID looked
  kinda like a moorhen walking around but with a much more muted beak. Maybe an
  immature but saw three of them and no adults.

  Figured I'd be pretty much done coming back along the other side, but a Great
  Egret was perched on a branch waiting to receive me. Also, another Royal Spoonbill
  even more resplendent than the last.

  Was trying to ID a duck (apparently there are shovelers around, never got one)
  when my bins raked over a Black-fronted Dotterel. What luck! I could hardly see
  it from shore even after knowing where it was, and would never have noticed it
  otherwise.

  Very successful outing with half the birds lifers. Stoked with the bins too.
