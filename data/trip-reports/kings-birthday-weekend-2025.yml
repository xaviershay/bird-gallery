  Stayed in Hallston (near Mount Worth) with Jodie for the long weekend.

  Hoping for a Superb Lyrebird and were not dissapointed, though most looks were
  fleeting as they ran off the road away from the car. Also found some Bassian
  Thrush.
  
  Took the coastal route home which yielded Australian Tern at blowy, rainy
  Stockyard Point, and an awesome encounter with a fishing Caspian Tern at what
  was intended to be a quick bathroom break.
