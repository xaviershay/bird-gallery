  Got on the bike to Dights Falls without a plan.
  
  Slow start but found my first Red-Rumped Parrot on the ground (with two
  immature Crimson Rosella) up near the sports oval. Returning along the river
  caught an Australasian Darter preening on a log - also a first.

  The afternoon was young so decided to make a day of it. Rode around to Royal
  Park Trin Warren Tam-boore, fueling at Billy van Creamy with a
  scoop each of Apple Pie and Peppermint Fudge. Best ice-cream I've eaten?
  Certainly close.

  Not much going at the wetlands but did find a nice female Superb Fairywren, and I
  think my first Spotted Dove at the location. Couple of Red Wattlebird and a
  White-plumed Honeyeater also good.

  Royal Park was incredibly dead, but did find a flock of Crested Pigeon near the
  native gardens, which is the most I've seen in one spot.

  Continued along the Capital City Trail to Docklands, hoping to pick up a Masked
  Lapwing which I haven't seen in Melbourne yet. Dipped on that but did get a
  stellar look at a Great Cormorant perched on the end of a pier (then jumping
  into the water, then taking off!)

  Finished the day with a quick lap of the Botanic Gardens, featuring all the
  regulars, but in particular some good Little Wattlebird views (which I haven't
  seen here before), some tricky Brown Thornbill, and pretty sure an Eastern
  Spinebill I'm not confident enough to claim.
