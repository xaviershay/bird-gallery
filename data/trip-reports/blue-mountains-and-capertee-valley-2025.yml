  Long weekend trip with Jodie.

  First stop on the way from Sydney was a bust: Penrith Weir was closed for
  trail work. Did catch our first Satin Bowerbird hanging out with some
  Australasian Figbird in a particularly fruitful tree.

  I wasn't hopeful for Euroka Campground as it was late morning and the sun had
  come out fierce. Jodie found some Tawny Frogmouth on her own for the first
  time, something I have still to achieve. We chased the call of a Noisy
  Friarbird into the bush until we saw it, got a fleeting look at a Black-faced
  Cuckooshrike, and found a massive Goanna at the base of a tree with two Satin
  Bowerbird.

  We had more stops planned along the way, but it was too hot so we skipped them.

  Some short evening hikes along the cliffs in Katoomba yielded a small number
  of commons, but most excitedly a Gray Butcherbird feeding its young and two
  soaring Little Eagles.

  The next morning we got up early to hike the Grand Canyon Loop near
  Blackheath, and it was the best location in the area. Large Yellow-tailed
  Black Cockatoo on the ridge, a number of tame Superb Lyrebird, four Eastern
  Whipbird down low where we got fantastic looks, and even two Rockwarblers came
  out on to the path as we descended. Saw our first Australian Rufous Fantail
  which was my bird of the trip - absolutely gorgeous.

  An evening out and back down the Furber steps was notable for two Lewin's
  Honeyeater out in clear view at the bottom of the cable car, and a spectacular
  Suphur-crested Cockatoo perch under Katoomba falls - see photo.

  Sunday we drove out to Capertee Valley. So many honeyeaters! Coorongooba
  Camping Area was particularly fruitful with a number of lifers: Fuscuous
  Honeyeater, Rufous Whistler, Fan-tailed Cuckoo, and a Restless Flycatcher. Not
  to mention Yellow-rumped Thornbil at the park entrance ("birdwatching site
  #8").

  Site #10 we picked up Rainbow Bee-eater, and two others I couldn't ID until I
  checked photos after: Rufous Songlark and White-bellied Cuckooshrike.

  We would never have stopped at Genowlan Bridge if it wasn't on a map, and even
  then almost skipped but some folk we met in the morning had stopped their for
  lunch. A somewhat reluctant ramble down the dry creek bed led to a fleeting
  Diamond Firetail and a flock of Brown-headed Honeyeater.
