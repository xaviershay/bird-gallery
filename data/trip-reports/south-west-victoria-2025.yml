  Big weekend with Kerry.

  Joined Birdlife Warrnambool in Timboon Saturday morning and checked out Power
  reserve and two sections of the rail trail. Lot of small birds in tall trees I
  struggled to ID, but had no trouble whatsoever with the King Parrots! Got a
  decent snap of a female Golden Whistler. Saw a White-throated Treecreeper creep up a tree -
  classic (and a lifer), and a beautiful view of a Gray Shrikethrush.

  Stopped in quickly at Tower Hill on the way back to Portland, was pretty dead
  until we found a lake with over a hundred Pink-eared Duck! Also a number of
  Australasian Shoveler, which I hadn't seen elsewhere yet.

  Tried the Gannet colony past Portland as the sun was setting but missed them by
  a week, they'd all moved offshore - still just visible through the camera.

  Birding local spots around Kerry's Sunday morning, some lovely swamps and small
  water holes. The one in Cobboboonee National Park was a stand out: lot of small
  birds coming close for a drink or a swim.

  Nabbed a few Whistling Kite over the highway on the way home for the final spot.
  Had seen one earlier but I hadn't been able to ID it myself.

  8 new small bird lifers! Took a while to make sense of all the honeyeaters but
  feeling somewhat confident now.
