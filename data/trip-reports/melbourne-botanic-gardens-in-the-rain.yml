  Was bucketing down but the radar showed a gap so took my chances.
  
  Got drenched on the bike getting there, but eased up not long after I got
  there and was treated to a spectacular sunset. Spotted a Little Black
  Cormorant then followed it in flight back to its tree ... to find 19 of its
  brethren(!) Finally located a Bell Miner despite poor light. Was watching a
  pair of Grey Fantail when two Nankeen Night Heron flew in behind me - lifer!
  Bats flying over at sunset weren't birds, but still great.
