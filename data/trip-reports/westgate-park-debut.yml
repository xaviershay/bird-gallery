  Cheeky post-work bird. Highlights:

  * A tree full of roosting Welcome Swallow. Took a while to ID them because could only see white underbelly. Also best view I've gotten yet of one of them in full flight.
  * Finally spotted a few Hardhead.
  * Hoary-headed Grebe look fantastic, I love them.
  * A big tree absolutely chockers with New Holland Honeyeater and a couple of Red Wattlebird.
  * Am quite certain of a number of female Superb Fairywren ... but no males. Weird?
  * A Pied Currawong blocking my path. Let me get close enough for a decent phone photo!
  * Finally getting a good enough look at a White-plumed Honeyeater to properly ID it, after (in hindsight) seeing a number earlier.
  * Two Little Black Cormorant hanging out with three Pelican.
  * A Red Wattlebird eating a worm.
  * An unexpected brief but solid eyeful of a Blackbird after I thought I was done.
  * One final check of the salt lake before finishing up, spotted a Pied Stilt in the distance rounding a corner. It and another then took off for a beautiful duet flying low over the lake. Thrilling!
