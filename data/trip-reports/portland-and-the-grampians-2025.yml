  Bringing in the New Year with Jodie.
  
  First stop was Tower Hill near Warrnambool where, after fending off Emu trying
  to eat our picnic, we hiked two short loops. Too hot and late in the day for
  much activity, but still found a number of smaller birds. Heard then found a
  Brush Bronzewing cooing in the trees, first lifer of the trip. 
  
  Next to Griffiths Island where we dipped on Short-tailed Shearwaters (there's
  a breeding colony there) but found a thousand-plus flock of Crested Tern.
  Lifers: Common Greenshank, Sooty Oystercatcher and Singing Honey Eater.
  
  Then on to the Gannet colony at Point Danger in Portland. I missed them by a
  week when I was hear earlier in the year, but there were plenty here now!
  
  Got around Kerry's patch the next morning, including Cobboboonee National
  Park, where we were treated to a Mistletoe Bird, Rose Robin, Blue-winged
  Parrot, and a Sacred Kingfisher. On to the Grampians, where an evening hike to
  the Balconies yielded an unexpected Scarlet Robin.
  
  Tuesday we were shown around by Neil from Birdswing tours, starting at Wendy &
  Neil's Grevillea Garden where we dipped on Painted Buttonquail that we caught
  occasional glimpses of, but got some great looks at Diamond Firetail and
  Striated Pardalote. Then to Stawell sewage ponds, where we got a couple of
  varied duck through the scope and a very close visit from a Black Kite. The
  weather turned (really winded) and we struggled to find much the rest of the
  day, but were surprised by a Latham Snipe(!) and Black-tailed Nativehen at a
  random roadside dam, then capped it off with two Powerful Owl(!!)
  
  Wednesday was mostly about hiking, but we did find an exciting mystery bird at
  Silverband Falls. I think it was most likely a Flame Robin, Jodie reckons it
  was a female Leaden Flycatcher. Unfortunately I wasn't carrying my camera.
  
  Thursday we got our first lifer of 2026: a Crescent Honeyeater on a hike to
  the Pinnacle from Wonderland carpark. Followed it up by twitching Blue-faced
  Honeyeater at Stawell library on the way home - we'd tried for it with Neil on
  Tuesday and dipped, but managed to find it this time.
