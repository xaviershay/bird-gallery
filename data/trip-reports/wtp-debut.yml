  First trip out to Western Treatment Plant!

  Arrived to Western Lagoon around 6:30am, slightly before there was sufficient light. Was planning for a hot day so was a bit underdressed. Saw three Yellow Spoonbill flyover, my first lifer for the day and surely a good omen.

  Proceeded on a slow drive around the Western Lagoon area. Took some time
  trying to get good looks at White-fronted Chat and Golden-headed Cisticola.
  Chased a falcon through a few different perches before getting a snap of it -
  I'm no good at IDing them yet but figured out afterwards it was a Brown
  Falcon. Also got very good flying looks at Black-shouldered Kite and Whistling
  Kite. Flushed a large flock of Straw-neck Ibis hidden in the grass. Met some
  lovely other birders searching for Bitten, who pointed out Cape Barren Goose
  and Brolga far in the distance. I could just make them out at camera max zoom,
  but luckily I came across both much closer later in the day.

  Visited Austin Rd bird hide. Some fantastic Brolga action just beforehand and a great shot of a Golden-headed Cisticola. Number of other good photos of common birds from the hide.

  Ran into Cape Barren Geese along the side of the road back up to Gate 5. Saw Musk Duck along Pacific Rd on the way to Little River Bird Hide, but didn't stop to note them down, figuring I'd see them again later.

  Huge number of birds at the hide, but the Pied Oystercatcher took the crown as the only one I hadn’t seen before. Also got my best look yet (and a blurry photo…) at a Whistling Kite in flight.

  Continued clockwise towards the boat-ramp, picking up Crested and White-winged Tern as well as Red-necked Avocet. Looped back to Gate 5, and not having seen Musk Duck again drove back down Pacific Rd to get it, along with some Hoary-headed Grebe - which is when I realised I likely misclassified a few Australasian Grebe throughout the day.

  Drove up to Ryan’s Swamp but it all seemed dead and closed off. Did have two hawks soaring close though which was fun. Thought they were Wedge-tails at the time but doubted myself after. Connected back to 160 South Rd, which you’re probably not supposed to do because the gate was locked, but thankfully the grain silo was open and I could exit that way. Excellent glimpse of a Nankeen Kestrel first sitting atop a road sign, then flying around.

  Tacked on a quick stop at Point Cook Coastal Park on the way home. Nothing new but some great photos of a Pacific Gull and another Brown Falcon.
